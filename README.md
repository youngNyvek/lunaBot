## ⚙ How it works

From the selection screen of warriors, the bot identifies if there are slots to be filled and identifies which warriors can be put into battle, following this way until returning to the selection screen, starting over again.

NOTHING is changed in the game code, as the bot uses the user's own screen as a base.
